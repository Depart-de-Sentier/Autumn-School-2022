# Logistics

The Autumn School will be held at the Seminar Hotel [Moeschberg](https://www.moeschberg.ch/), just outside the village of [Grosshöchstetten](https://map.search.ch/Grossh%C3%B6chstetten).

## Arrival

The School starts at 10:00 on Monday, October 24th. You should already be in the hotel and settled down by that time.

There will be a welcome snack for those who didn't have time to get breakfast.

There will be a shuttle van meeting the train connections to Grosshöchstetten arriving at 8:54, 9:04, and 9:40. Given that almost 40 people are arriving on these connections, we recommend putting your luggage in the shuttle and walking up to the hotel, which is around 10 minutes on foot. There will be instructors leading the way for the 9:04 and 9:40 connections.

## End

The school will end at 16:00 on Friday, October 28th. For those who want to celebrate their work together, we will offer a small apéro with drinks and snacks from 16:00 to 17:30.

Please plan to stay until 16:00 if at all possible. On Friday afternoon we will have the group presentations and conclude with some important information on future plans and opportunities for collaboration. The earliest possible train connection one could realistically take is at 16:17.

# Food

All food is provided from the Monday welcome snack to Friday lunch, and the hotel prides themselves on their [organic and regional cuisine](https://www.moeschberg.ch/biogarni/). There will be a vegetarian option for all meals. Coffee and tea area available throughout the day.
